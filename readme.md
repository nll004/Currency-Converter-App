## Assignment
Using the forex.python.converter module I build a simple front end form to take and convert currencies.
I practiced writing tests for flask requests and to handle errors with the form.

## To Do
The css could use work. I quickly created the stylesheet since the primary focus was experimenting with the tests and backend.
